<h2>Razor Reports - a Visualizer for the DotNetNuke Reports Module</h2>
<p>Version 1.0.0</p>
<p>Razor Reports is a visualizer for the DotNetNuke Reports Module. It is a spezialized extension, though it is installable like any other DotNetNuke extension.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>DotNetNuke 5.6.0</li>
    <li>DotNetNuke Razor Host Module 1.0 Beta</li>
    <li>.Net 4.0</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Razor Reports is my entry for the DotNetNuke Razor Hackathon. It integrates the 
    &lt;b&gt;Razor Host Module&lt;/b&gt; as visualizer for the DNN Reports module and resuses 
    its Script Editor and Settings controls. It only introduces one single extension 
    &lt;i&gt;Dnn.ReportResults()&lt;/i&gt; to the DnnHelper Object to allow access to the Report 
    data as a System.Data.DataTable. The included script <i>_RazorReports_PlainTable.cshtml</i> 
    is a good sarting place for own scripts.</p>
<p>
    I can imagine that Razor is going to play an important part within DotNetNuke as 
    it provides a powerfull and easy to learn template engine. I can imagine future 
    Razor support within the Form and List or the Xml module, as an alternatice to 
    XSLT.</p>
